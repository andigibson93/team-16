<body>
I had ruined my life entirely. In the last 19 years, I have gotten all of it back and so much more!
I work every day to help others find what I have! I am surrounded by the people who helped me get clean and sober.
My family has accepted me back and trusts me again. My son is my best friend. I get to be "Nana" to my 3 grandchildren and
I have a great relationship with my daughter in law. I own a brand new home. I get to pursue my hobbies and I am the happiest I have ever been.
I am not ashamed of my past, because it made me who I am today and today I am proud of me. I am proud to be a person in long term recovery.

<br><br>
<b>I AM PROUD</b> to be able to help others. I am proud I am able to look outside of myself even on my worst day and find things to be grateful for.
I understand I wasn't a horrible person, ever, not deep down. I was rendered incapable of showing that person by my fears, flawed thinking,
flawed beliefs about myself, and the shame I carried every day. I have a choice every day, Do I continue to be the person I have become,
or allow the old beliefs to push me back into the scared, confused, misdirected person I used to be?
It took a long time to get where I am and today I have been sober longer than I used.
My new "habit" is sobriety. I owe this to the faith others put in me when I had none for myself. I owe this to treatment.
I am a person in long term recovery and today I hold my head high when I say this to others! My hope is someday, someday,
everyone can hold their head high and say the same for themselves!!

  <p> Hey, I want to know if you had any advice for me? My mom wants to get help to get over addiction, but everytime
  she tries to get help, she thinks it won't work and gives up before trying. How can I get her help. I am just 14.</p>

  <p>Thanks for reaching out to me, the best way to help your mom is to make her become more aware of the success
  is to have her get involved with others who are going through the same situation, maybe even get her to talk to me. </p>
